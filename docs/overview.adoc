= Overview

nx is an unobstrusive asynchronous and multithreaded library modeled after
modern equivalent libraries found in scripting languages.

It emphasizes on using operator overloading for almost every aspect of HTTP
request and reponse handling, focusing more on what you want to express in an
"HTTP way" rather than how to do it in C++.
